        <p class="description tk-adelle alwaysshow">
            I am a UX Developer, currently enrolled in the Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program at Carnegie Mellon University. 
        </p>

        <p class="description tk-adelle alwaysshow">

            I hail from the placid suburbia of Northern Virginia, and I did my undergrad at the University of Virginia, graduating with a double-major in computer science and religious studies and a minor in studio art.
        </p>

        <p class="description tk-adelle alwaysshow">
            My goal for the next year is to work as a UX Developer in a hybrid role between design and technology. Technology is a creative medium that I don’t see myself giving up; at the same time, I have a lot to offer on the design side, especially product management, information architecture, and interaction design.
        </p>

        <p class="description tk-adelle alwaysshow">
            In five years, my goal is to be leading a design team. Design is better together, and keeping projects moving forward in a strategic way keeps everyone happy. I love participating in every stage of product design, from research through design and development, and so I’d like to grow into a role where I can work with each stage and keep all of the pieces moving in synchrony.
